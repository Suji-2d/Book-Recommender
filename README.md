# Book-Recommender

### Introduction:
The Book Recommendation System project aimed to develop a recommendation matrix, book_index.csv, utilizing MapReduce HPCI (High-Performance Computing Interface) and incorporating a user-based collaborative filtering technique. The project also involved developing a user interface (UI) for the recommendation system using Streamlit.

### Recommendation Matrix:
The project created a recommendation matrix, book_index.csv, which contains the likeability scores of the top 10 books for over 9000 books. The matrix was generated using MapReduce HPCI, a parallel processing framework, to efficiently process large volumes of data. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, the recommendation matrix was constructed based on user preferences and interactions with books.

### User-Based Collaborative Filtering:
The recommendation matrix employed a user-based collaborative filtering technique. This technique relies on finding similarities between users based on their book preferences and then recommending books that are liked by users with similar preferences. By analyzing user behavior and identifying patterns of similarity, the system provides personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience.

### Streamlit User Interface:
Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, was utilized to develop a user-friendly and intuitive UI for the book recommendation system. The UI provides a seamless and engaging experience for users to input their preferences and receive personalized book recommendations based on the recommendation matrix.

### Usage:

Ensure the book_index.csv recommendation matrix is loaded into the system.
Launch the Streamlit UI application by running the designated script.
Users can input their preferences, such as favorite genres, authors, or previously read books.
The recommendation system processes the user's input and utilizes the recommendation matrix to generate personalized book recommendations.
The UI displays the top recommended books based on the user's preferences, along with their likeability scores.

### Conclusion:
The Book Recommendation System project successfully developed a recommendation matrix using MapReduce HPCI, incorporating user-based collaborative filtering techniques. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, the system provides accurate and personalized book recommendations. The Streamlit UI enhances the user experience by providing an intuitive interface to interact with the recommendation system. The project opens avenues for further improvements in the book recommendation domain, improving user satisfaction and fostering a love for reading.
